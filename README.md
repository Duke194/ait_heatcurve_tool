Reverse-Engineered Alpha Innotec Heating Curve Calculator
This tool is a reverse-engineered calculator designed to determine the heating curves used in Alpha Innotec heat pumps with the Luxtronik 2.0 controller. It allows users to adjust the endpoint (target temperature at -20°C) and the footpoint (parallel shift of the curve) to visualize the resulting heating curve.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This tool is based on observed behavior and is not an official Alpha Innotec product. All calculations are provided without warranty.

Features
🔹 Adjustable Heating Curve Parameters
🔹 Live Visualization of the Curve
🔹 Dark Mode for Better Readability
🔹 Free & Open-Source
